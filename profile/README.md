We all love to view and research new projects on GitHub. Some of them have screenshots and videos, others don't. Well, wouldn't it be great if at the distance of a click you could get a demo of that particular project?

We made that possible for Flutter projects: since most Flutter apps are cross-compatible in different platforms (mobile, web, desktop), even if one built an app for iOS, I could test it as an web app

## Architecture

Ukoreh was designed with a pipeline visualization approach and it can summarized in a workflow/swimlane diagram:
